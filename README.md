------------------------------
If you have no experience using JupyterLab, there is a great 6 minute video explaining a bit about it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU 
Of particular interest to first-time users will be from timestamp 4:40 onwards where the narrator explains how to execute code.

**To summarise though**, all you need to do is click on a cell (block of code) and hit SHIFT + ENTER together.

The easiest way to use the notebooks is to launch JupyterLab in your web browser ( please follow the instructions below).
1. Download this repository (and unzip if necessary) or the individual files you wish to play around with
2. Go to https://jupyter.org/try
3. Click "Try JupyterLab" and wait for the environment to setup.
4. Under the "Notebook" heading in the centre of the screen, click the "Python3" widget
5. Near the top left of the screen, click the "Upload Files" button and navigate through your file browser to upload all the notebooks to JupyterLab

6. Now you can open a notebook and interact with them!

Hello! Attached are the jupyter notebooks for Computing in the Classrooms Report 1.
I wrote these jupyter notebooks to aid students in their final year of high school in Scotland to apply the computational thinking and programming skills they've picked up in Visual Basic at Higher to a new language - Python.

The different notebook topics are denoted by their numbers, followed by the subject addressed inside and whether they are a worksheet or an answer sheet.
