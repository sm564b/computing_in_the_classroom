------------------------------
If you have no experience using JupyterLab, there is a great 6 minute video explaining a bit about it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU 
Of particular interest to first-time users will be from timestamp 4:40 onwards where the narrator explains how to execute code.

**To summarise though**, all you need to do to execute code is click on the cell (block of code) and hit SHIFT + ENTER together. Functions are only initilaised once their cell has been run, so calls in later cells to uninitialised functions and variables won't work.

The easiest way to use the notebooks is to launch JupyterLab in your web browser ( please follow the instructions below).
1. Download this repository (and unzip if necessary) or the individual files you wish to play around with
2. Go to https://jupyter.org/try
3. Click "Try JupyterLab" and wait for the environment to setup.
4. Under the "Notebook" heading in the centre of the screen, click the "Python3" widget
5. Near the top left of the screen, click the "Upload Files" button and navigate through your file browser to upload all the notebooks to JupyterLab

6. Now you can open a notebook and interact with them!

Hello! Attached are the jupyter notebooks for Assignment 2 for Computing in the Classroom.
I wrote these jupyter notebooks as an extension to those found in the main branch. These extra books are a bit trickier as they try to teach the use of classes in Python by way of: Introduce concept, show example of how it works, ask the student to give it a go.

There are two distinct notebook topics, with a worksheet and accompanying answer sheet for each.
