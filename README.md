If you have no experience using JupyterLab, there is a great 6 minute video explainign a bit about it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU 
Of particular interest to first-time users will be from timestamp 4:40 onwards where the narrator explains how to execute code

The easiest way to use the notebooks is to launch JupyterLab in your web browser (follow the instructions below).
1. Download this repository or the individual files you wish to play around with
2. Go to https://jupyter.org/try
3. Click "Try JupyterLab" and wait for the environment to setup.
4. Under the "Notebook" heading in the cnetre of the screen, click the "Python3" widget

Hello! Attached are the jupyter notebooks for Computing in the Classrooms Report 1.
I wrote these jupyter notebooks to aid students in their final year of high school in Scotland to pick up some key programming and computational thinking skills that are lacking in Visual Basic and the Higher curriculum but are required at university level.

The different notebook topics are denoted by their numbers, followed by the subject addressed inside and whether they are a worksheet or an answer sheet.
